# Kotlin-Projects
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I actively participated in several exciting Kotlin projects within the Computer Science Club. Together with the club, we embarked on a journey of creativity and problem-solving. We developed a variety of engaging games, including classics like Connect 4, as well as educational tools such as a Chess Dictionary. Additionally, we took on the challenge of creating a Memory Game that tested our programming and design skills. Moreover, we started the ambitious task of crafting a chess game, which allowed us to delve into the intricacies of game development and sharpen our Kotlin programming expertise. These projects not only kept us engaged during challenging times but also provided a valuable learning experience for all involved.
